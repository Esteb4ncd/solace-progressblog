      <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We’re thrilled to announce that Solace has been selected as one of the ten projects to pitch this term! After the selection, Sarah and Esteban came together to form the team, bringing together a group of creative and dedicated members ready to bring this vision to life.</p>


<h2>Meet the Team</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sarah</strong> – Project Manager, Frontend Developer, Co-Product Owner</li>
<li><strong>Esteban</strong> – Lead Developer, Co-Product Owner</li>
<li><strong>Mateusz</strong> – Lead Designer</li>
<li><strong>Rosie</strong> – UI/UX Designer, Scrum Master</li>
<li><strong>Hyunjung</strong> – Brand Designer</li>
<li><strong>Angel</strong> – UI/UX Designer</li>
<li><strong>Zinna</strong> – AI & Backend Developer</li>
</ul>


<h2>Laying the Foundation</h2>
<p>Once our team was set, we gathered to get familiar with the idea behind Solace and ensure everyone was aligned. This first conversation gave us the chance to share perspectives, ask questions, and start shaping the direction of the project together.</p>


<h2>Sprint One: First Steps</h2>
<p>With the vision clear, we kicked off our first sprint. Everyone jumped into action: research began, sketches of early features started to form, and the first design ideas began to emerge. Here’s how we got started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zinna explored APIs</li>
<li>Sarah and Rosie carried out a competitive analysis using Wim’s template</li>
<li>Esteban began setting up our blog</li>
<li>Rosie, Rachel, Angel, and Mateusz brainstormed features and drafted rough sketches</li>
<li>Mateusz and Rachel worked on early logo concepts</li>
<li>Sarah began user research</li>
</ul>


<h2>Keeping on Track</h2>
<p>To stay organized and connected, we’ve set our weekly meetings for <strong>Mondays at 11:30 AM</strong>. These meetings give us a regular space to share progress, adjust priorities, and keep momentum strong.</p>


<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>The first sketches and research are already taking shape, and the energy in the team is building. We’re just at the beginning, but Solace is already moving from idea to reality—and we couldn’t be more excited to see where this journey takes us.</p>

      description:`<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Week 2 was all about identity and direction for Solace — from logos and
  features to research prep and our first steps in development.
</p>

<h2>Branding & Features</h2>
<p>
  Our ideation crew (Rosie, Rachel, Angel, Matt) sketched out feature concepts,
  while Matt and Rachel drafted early logos. After some lively debate, we voted
  on two favorites and locked in a color palette that feels calm yet energizing.
</p>

<h2>Research Prep</h2>
<p>
  Sarah led the charge on survey and interview planning, setting us up to gather
  real user insights in the next sprint.
</p>

<h2>Development Progress</h2>
<p>
  On the dev side, Zinna researched APIs, while Esteban set up the repo and Expo
  environment to get the project rolling.
</p>

<h2>Mentor Check-Ins</h2>
<p><strong>Daemon:</strong> Talked target audience, features, and branding feedback.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Henry:</strong> Revisited our team charter, explored AI integration, and
  mapped first development steps.
</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>
  Rosie and Rachel started work on a project poster, and as a team we laid out
  our next sprint, with a focus on user research, refining designs, and building
  on our dev setup.
</p>

<h2>Wrap-Up</h2>
<p>
  Week 2 gave us clarity — a visual identity, sharper features, and our first dev
  foundations. With momentum building, Week 3 is where we start putting Solace
  to the test.
</p>
