      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>We’re thrilled to announce that Solace has been selected as one of the ten projects to pitch this term! After the selection, Sarah and Esteban came together to form the team, bringing together a group of creative and dedicated members ready to bring this vision to life.</p>

      <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sarah</strong> – Project Manager, Frontend Developer, Co-Product Owner</li>
        <li><strong>Esteban</strong> – Lead Developer, Co-Product Owner</li>
        <li><strong>Mateusz</strong> – Lead Designer</li>
        <li><strong>Rosie</strong> – UI/UX Designer, Scrum Master</li>
        <li><strong>Hyunjung</strong> – Brand Designer</li>
        <li><strong>Angel</strong> – UI/UX Designer</li>
        <li><strong>Zinna</strong> – AI & Backend Developer</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Laying the Foundation</h2>
      <p>Once our team was set, we gathered to get familiar with the idea behind Solace and ensure everyone was aligned. This first conversation gave us the chance to share perspectives, ask questions, and start shaping the direction of the project together.</p>

      <h2>Sprint One: First Steps</h2>
      <p>With the vision clear, we kicked off our first sprint. Everyone jumped into action: research began, sketches of early features started to form, and the first design ideas began to emerge. Here’s how we got started:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Zinna explored APIs</li>
        <li>Sarah and Rosie carried out a competitive analysis using Wim’s template</li>
        <li>Esteban began setting up our blog</li>
        <li>Rosie, Rachel, Angel, and Mateusz brainstormed features and drafted rough sketches</li>
        <li>Mateusz and Rachel worked on early logo concepts</li>
        <li>Sarah began user research</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Keeping on Track</h2>
      <p>To stay organized and connected, we’ve set our weekly meetings for <strong>Mondays at 11:30 AM</strong>. These meetings give us a regular space to share progress, adjust priorities, and keep momentum strong.</p>

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>The first sketches and research are already taking shape, and the energy in the team is building. We’re just at the beginning, but Solace is already moving from idea to reality—and we couldn’t be more excited to see where this journey takes us.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Week 2 was all about identity and direction for Solace — from logos and features to research prep and our first steps in development.</p>

      <h2>Branding & Features</h2>
      <p>Our ideation crew (Rosie, Rachel, Angel, Matt) sketched out feature concepts, while Matt and Rachel drafted early logos. After some lively debate, we voted on two favorites and locked in a color palette that feels calm yet energizing.</p>

      <h2>Research Prep</h2>
      <p>Sarah led the charge on survey and interview planning, setting us up to gather real user insights in the next sprint.</p>

      <h2>Development Progress</h2>
      <p>On the dev side, Zinna researched APIs, while Esteban set up the repo and Expo environment to get the project rolling.</p>

      <h2>Mentor Check-Ins</h2>
      <p><strong>Daemon:</strong> Talked target audience, features, and branding feedback.</p>
      <p><strong>Henry:</strong> Revisited our team charter, explored AI integration, and mapped first development steps.</p>

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>Rosie and Rachel started work on a project poster, and as a team we laid out our next sprint, with a focus on user research, refining designs, and building on our dev setup.</p>

      <h2>Wrap-Up</h2>
      <p>Week 2 gave us clarity — a visual identity, sharper features, and our first dev foundations. With momentum building, Week 3 is where we start putting Solace to the test.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>We’ve officially wrapped up Week 3 of our project, and the momentum is building. This week was all about digging deeper into competitive analysis, advancing our user research, and starting to shape both the design and development foundations. From setting up our technical tools to sketching low-fi features and creating a style guide, every team member contributed to moving us closer to defining our core product direction.</p>

      <h2>What We Did</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zinna:</strong> Focused on AI research and putting up the survey poster.</li>
        <li><strong>Esteban:</strong> Worked on analysis, set up the Expo repository, researched APIs (including Expo), and drafted development criteria.</li>
        <li><strong>Mat:</strong> Developed designer criteria and established consistent styles within our Figma file.</li>
        <li><strong>Sarah:</strong> Pushed forward with front-end blog setup, conducted user interviews, and ran a user survey.</li>
        <li><strong>Rachel:</strong> Worked on survey poster design, explored logo options, sketched low-fi features, and reviewed the survey rubric.</li>
        <li><strong>Rosie:</strong> Helped with the survey poster and participated in low-fi check-in sketches.</li>
        <li><strong>Angel:</strong> Contributed to the user survey and created low-fi ideas focused on motivation and gamification.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Advisor Meeting</h2>
      <p>We are aiming to confirm a regular advisor meeting time. Options under consideration are Monday or Friday mornings around 11 a.m., or Wednesday at 3 p.m.</p>

      <h2>Design and Low-Fi Progress</h2>
      <p>Our design team began developing early low-fi concepts, explored check-in features, and brainstormed gamification ideas, such as caring for a pet or building a virtual house. One key decision is to ensure the design team aligns on a single, consistent style across the project.</p>

      <h2>User Research Report</h2>
      <p>Work has started on our User Research Report. Zinna is writing the introduction and summary, with action points and recommendations. Esteban is drafting the conclusion with recommendations. Rachel and Rosie are handling secondary research sections. Mat is identifying key user pain points and frustrations. Angel and Sarah are summarizing major findings, with Rosie sharing a previous report as a reference.</p>

      <h2>Next Steps for Designers</h2>
      <p>The designers are updating the style guide: Mat on typography, Angel on color palette, Rachel refining the logo, and Rosie on layout. They will apply Daemon’s feedback and continue ideating main features based on user research.</p>

      <h2>Next Steps for Developers</h2>
      <p>Sarah’s branch will be merged into the main repository for blog deployment. Blog posts will continue according to rotation: Esteban publishes Week 2, Zinna publishes Week 3, and the team reviews overall design and formatting for consistency.</p>

      <h2>Everyone’s Focus for Next Week</h2>
      <p>The entire team will finalize the User Research Report, pull the Expo repository for Sonya’s class, and continue aligning design and development with the main feature set.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Week 4 was all about translating research into design direction and beginning to shape our core features. With user reports completed, we moved into wireframing, style guide updates, and API exploration. Our team also refined ideas around stretches, check-ins, and gamification, while continuing to align design and development for the product’s foundation.</p>

      <h2>What We Did</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rosie:</strong> Arranged a meeting with Jenny from Forge, submitted the Competitive & User Report, created Sprint 3, and contributed to onboarding, check-in, and home wireframes. She also updated layout elements in the style guide and conducted additional research on muscle groups and related stretches.</li>
        <li><strong>Sarah:</strong> Wrote the Week 1 blog post, advanced the User Research Report, and scheduled an advisor meeting.</li>
        <li><strong>Esteban:</strong> Explored APIs, contributed to the User Research Report and its formatting, published the Week 2 blog post, and edited the survey Excel format.</li>
        <li><strong>Zinna:</strong> Published the Week 3 blog post, worked on the User Research Report, and helped refine the survey Excel format.</li>
        <li><strong>Mateusz:</strong> Focused on gamification wireframing and the User Research Report.</li>
        <li><strong>Rachel:</strong> Pushed logo design forward, completed her section of the User Research Report, researched muscle group pain points and impacts on trade workers, and began wireframing the tracking feature.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Wireframing & Design Feedback</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check-in:</strong> Clear and intuitive.</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep & Mindfulness:</strong> Strong add-on, simple breathing/tips, optional by design.</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking Flow:</strong> Works smoothly.</li>
        <li><strong>Stretching:</strong> Leaning toward short standing videos rather than illustrations.</li>
        <li><strong>Gamification:</strong> Streaks and engagement mechanics are promising.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On the UI side, we’re aligning around construction-focused features with consistent styling.</p>

      <h2>Main Features</h2>
      <p>The scope feels realistic and achievable. Core areas include: check-ins, stretching support, tracking, mindfulness/sleep features, and gamification.</p>

      <h2>Advisor Meeting</h2>
      <p>We’ll follow Henry’s meeting agenda and bring updates to Jenny during Friday’s session. Next Monday, we’ll start at 10 a.m. in the study room to kick off Sprint 4 together.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monday 4:30 p.m. – Designers Design Specs Meeting (can be moved to before class if needed)</li>
        <li>Wednesday 3–4 p.m. – Advisor meeting with Kenner</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Design Team:</strong> Focus on mid-fi wireframes with consistent components:
          <ul>
            <li>Rosie → Home & Main Stretch</li>
            <li>Rachel → Progress</li>
            <li>Mateusz → Gamification</li>
            <li>Angel → Mindfulness & Sleep Support</li>
            <li>Zinna → Happy Path & overall user flow</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Logo work will move to the backlog for now.</li>
        <li><strong>Development Team:</strong> Practice building components in Expo:
          <ul>
            <li>Esteban → simple API integration</li>
            <li>Sarah → checklist component</li>
            <li>Zinna → Connecting Google Calendar to our Expo project</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Teamwide Deliverables:</strong> Completing two user personas (Sarah & Esteban) with decorated designs by Mateusz.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Closing</h2>
      <p>This week solidified our project’s foundation by turning research into actionable design and development steps. With wireframes, features, and personas underway, we’re well on our way to shaping Solace into a meaningful product for construction workers.</p>
