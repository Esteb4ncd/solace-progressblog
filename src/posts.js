      <h2>Sprint One: First Steps</h2>
      <p>With the vision clear, we kicked off our first sprint. Everyone jumped into action: research began, sketches of early features started to form, and the first design ideas began to emerge. Here’s how we got started:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Zinna explored APIs</li>
        <li>Sarah and Rosie carried out a competitive analysis using Wim’s template</li>
        <li>Esteban began setting up our blog</li>
        <li>Rosie, Rachel, Angel, and Mateusz brainstormed features and drafted rough sketches</li>
        <li>Mateusz and Rachel worked on early logo concepts</li>
        <li>Sarah began user research</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Keeping on Track</h2>
      <p>To stay organized and connected, we’ve set our weekly meetings for <strong>Mondays at 11:30 AM</strong>. These meetings give us a regular space to share progress, adjust priorities, and keep momentum strong.</p>

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>The first sketches and research are already taking shape, and the energy in the team is building. We’re just at the beginning, but Solace is already moving from idea to reality—and we couldn’t be more excited to see where this journey takes us.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>We’ve officially wrapped up Week 3 of our project, and the momentum is building. This week was all about digging deeper into competitive analysis, advancing our user research, and starting to shape both the design and development foundations. From setting up our technical tools to sketching low-fi features and creating a style guide, every team member contributed to moving us closer to defining our core product direction.</p>

      <h2>What We Did</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zinna:</strong> Focused on AI research and putting up the survey poster.</li>
        <li><strong>Esteban:</strong> Worked on analysis, set up the Expo repository, researched APIs (including Expo), and drafted development criteria.</li>
        <li><strong>Mat:</strong> Developed designer criteria and established consistent styles within our Figma file.</li>
        <li><strong>Sarah:</strong> Pushed forward with front-end blog setup, conducted user interviews, and ran a user survey.</li>
        <li><strong>Rachel:</strong> Worked on survey poster design, explored logo options, sketched low-fi features, and reviewed the survey rubric.</li>
        <li><strong>Rosie:</strong> Helped with the survey poster and participated in low-fi check-in sketches.</li>
        <li><strong>Angel:</strong> Contributed to the user survey and created low-fi ideas focused on motivation and gamification.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Advisor Meeting</h2>
      <p>We are aiming to confirm a regular advisor meeting time. Options under consideration are Monday or Friday mornings around 11 a.m., or Wednesday at 3 p.m.</p>

      <h2>Design and Low-Fi Progress</h2>
      <p>Our design team began developing early low-fi concepts, explored check-in features, and brainstormed gamification ideas, such as caring for a pet or building a virtual house. One key decision is to ensure the design team aligns on a single, consistent style across the project.</p>

      <h2>User Research Report</h2>
      <p>Work has started on our User Research Report. Zinna is writing the introduction and summary, with action points and recommendations. Esteban is drafting the conclusion with recommendations. Rachel and Rosie are handling secondary research sections. Mat is identifying key user pain points and frustrations. Angel and Sarah are summarizing major findings, with Rosie sharing a previous report as a reference.</p>

      <h2>Next Steps for Designers</h2>
      <p>The designers are updating the style guide: Mat on typography, Angel on color palette, Rachel refining the logo, and Rosie on layout. They will apply Daemon’s feedback and continue ideating main features based on user research.</p>

      <h2>Next Steps for Developers</h2>
      <p>Sarah’s branch will be merged into the main repository for blog deployment. Blog posts will continue according to rotation: Esteban publishes Week 2, Zinna publishes Week 3, and the team reviews overall design and formatting for consistency.</p>

      <h2>Everyone’s Focus for Next Week</h2>
      <p>The entire team will finalize the User Research Report, pull the Expo repository for Sonya’s class, and continue aligning design and development with the main feature set.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In Week 5, our design team focused on refining key features such as onboarding and daily check-ins based on insights from our advisor and instructor meetings. We also made progress on our logo design to move toward finalization. Additionally, we had another valuable advisor session with Jenny, where we gained deeper insights into our target audience—trade workers—and received feedback on our overall wireframing approach.</p>
  
      <h2>What We Did</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rosie:</strong> Designed onboarding flow, daily check-in, and home page stretch components in mid-fi; set up the meeting with Jenny; and created initial logo sketches.</li>
        <li><strong>Rachel:</strong> Worked on logo design, reviewed and edited personas based on rubric, and developed storyboard and script ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>Esteban:</strong> Updated secondary user persona, contributed to blog updates, developed storytelling ideas for personas, and tested API integration in Expo.</li>
        <li><strong>Sarah:</strong> Focused on the primary user persona, created a simple checklist component in Expo, led the advisor meeting with the agenda, researched the new target segment (ironworkers), and refined the problem statement, value proposition, and elevator pitch.</li>
        <li><strong>Mateusz:</strong> Worked on logo design concepts and user persona layout.</li>
        <li><strong>Angel:</strong> Built the information architecture, site map, and low-fidelity wireframes for “Sleep Help,” “Breathing,” “Mental Health Home,” and “To-Do List” pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Zinna:</strong> Researched APIs, tested API integration in Expo, and designed the happy path flow.</li>
        <li><strong>All:</strong> Collaborated on the site map.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Wireframing & Design Feedback</h2>
      <p>For onboarding, advisors expressed interest in push notifications to help users stay consistent despite their demanding work schedules.</p>
      <p>For check-ins, our team’s discussion highlighted the importance of integrating the user’s work schedule to ensure a seamless experience. We plan to explore how frequently their shifts change and whether they use existing scheduling platforms. This will help us create a smoother flow. Additionally, by allowing users to log their daily tasks, our AI can suggest personalized stretches that match their specific activities.</p>
  
      <h2>Main Features</h2>
      <p>Our current project scope feels realistic and achievable, focusing on these key areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Daily check-ins</li>
        <li>Stretching support</li>
        <li>Progress tracking</li>
        <li>Mindfulness and sleep tools</li>
        <li>Gamification</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We are continuously refining these features based on feedback from both our instructor and advisor meetings.</p>
  
      <h2>Advisor Meeting</h2>
      <p>Here are key insights from our recent meeting with Jenny (Advisor):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tone of Voice:</strong> Serious but with humor—use memes or celebratory messages like “Hell ya, way to go!” to keep motivation high.</li>
        <li><strong>Color Palette:</strong> Use dark tones (like black) with accent colors to create a sense of belonging—avoid clinical or “hospital” tones.</li>
        <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Let users input their own schedules since their shifts vary frequently and don’t follow standard office hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing Insight:</strong> Emphasize how pain prevention through stretching is better than relying on chemical pain relief.</li>
        <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Focus on ages 20–40. A younger focus may alienate the majority of the target users.</li>
        <li><strong>Community & Stigma:</strong> There’s less stigma around discussing physical pain—many trade workers already engage in wellness activities like the gym or meditation. Encourage using the app socially.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Oct 8th – Iron Worker Field Tour with Kenner, NE12 rm 101</h2>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> NE12</p>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We toured the NE12 site, where the Iron Workers operate, and had the opportunity to observe their work environment and daily tasks.</p>
  
      <h3>Key Learnings about Iron Workers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Iron workers always work in pairs for safety and efficiency.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>Main Categories of Iron Work</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Structural Iron Work:</strong> Carry 50–60 lbs of steel tools on their belts while climbing, work with cranes to lift and position steel beams, and perform welding and torch cutting.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement (Rebar Work):</strong> Focus on reinforcing concrete structures with rebar, requiring constant attention to detail and safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Ornamental Iron Work:</strong> Involves polishing and installing decorative or finishing metal pieces such as braces and railings.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>Common Injuries</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Lower back pain – due to heavy lifting and repetitive motion.</li>
        <li>Hand injuries – from handling steel and tools.</li>
        <li>Eye injuries – from welding, cutting, and debris.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h4>Observations</h4>
      <p>Iron workers perform many repetitive tasks, such as lifting and carrying steel on their shoulders, setting it down, and repeating the process throughout the day. The work is physically demanding and requires constant focus on safety and team coordination. The environment is very loud, and there are dangers everywhere.</p>
  
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Designers:</strong>

    description: `
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In Week 6, our team focused on refining our high-fidelity designs, applying mentor and advisor feedback, and preparing for upcoming user testing. The week was full of creative collaboration, detailed review, and meaningful progress across both design and development.</p>
  
      <h2>What We Did</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sarah:</strong> Sketched the storyboard, researched the sleep API, and wrote user persona scenarios.</li>
        <li><strong>Esteban:</strong> Created storyboard sketches, worked on the UI library, and reviewed and submitted the user persona rubric.</li>
        <li><strong>Zinna:</strong> Sketched the storyboard and designed the breathing exercise function.</li>
        <li><strong>Rosie:</strong> Developed the style guide, created storyboard sketches, and ideated and wireframed the AI push notification alarm screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Rachel:</strong> Updated the color palette, added new colors to the style guide, created wireframes for the Settings page, Navigation flow, AI version onboarding, and Dissociate (completion) screen; designed and finalized the Settings section; built missing components; and contributed to storyboard ideation and sketches.</li>
        <li><strong>Mateusz:</strong> Drew user persona scenario illustrations and developed mascot and logo concepts.</li>
        <li><strong>Angel:</strong> Contributed to storyboard ideation, prototyping, AI screen ideation, and wireframed the Account page.</li>
        <li><strong>All:</strong> Collaborated on the Advertisement Storyboards.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Wireframing & Design Feedback</h2>
      <p>Our team received valuable feedback on how to make our wireframes and overall design more cohesive and user-friendly. One of the main points was to improve the onboarding flow by adding a “Back” button on the final screen (“We’re all set”) and replacing the numerical step names like “Warm-up,” “2nd,” and “3rd” with more descriptive, non-numerical labels. These changes would make the onboarding experience smoother and more intuitive.</p>
      <p>We also learned that our gamification elements could be clearer and more consistent across the app. Clarifying the XP logic and ensuring that all related visuals align would help users better understand how progress and rewards work. Adding a short tutorial or pop-up slides explaining how the mascot and XP system function could further enhance engagement.</p>
      <p>Additionally, incorporating the user’s schedule into the home screen was highlighted as an important improvement. Showing upcoming exercises and related tasks directly on the main page will make the app better reflect the user’s daily routine. Linking exercise videos from the onboarding schedule screen will also help users start their routines more easily.</p>
      <p>Although these changes haven’t been implemented yet, our team believes that applying this feedback will make the app more consistent, engaging, and aligned with user needs. We plan to integrate these updates in the next design iteration after user testing.</p>
  
      <h2>Main Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Refine visual consistency and color palette across all screens.</li>
        <li>Keep the mascot simple and meaningful—3D rendering isn’t necessary.</li>
        <li>Have the mascot represent stretching or breathing exercises.</li>
        <li>Reinforce schedule integration on the home screen as the app’s anchor.</li>
        <li>Add visuals of targeted muscle groups for each exercise.</li>
        <li>Display upcoming exercises or activities clearly within the schedule.</li>
        <li>Ensure interactive elements are visually clear for intuitive navigation.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Research & Analysis Feedback</h2>
      <p>After reviewing feedback with Wim, we identified key ways to improve the depth and clarity of our research reports:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make the competitive analysis more specific and detailed, avoiding overly generic insights.</li>
        <li>Expand the competitor list beyond 15 and organize findings into clear categories.</li>
        <li>In user scenarios, focus on actual user workflows and real pain points instead of hypothetical app behavior.</li>
        <li>Improve report readability by refining layout, spacing, and grouping related content together.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Advisor Meeting with Kenner</h2>
      <p>Our meeting with Kenner gave us valuable insights into how users interact with the current high-fidelity designs. We learned which elements are intuitive and engaging, and where usability could be improved. Highlights included the AI-assisted check-ins, relaxation features like white noise and breathing exercises, and flexible input options (typing and multiple selections). Users emphasized personalization options and the need for adaptable schedules to match varying work shifts.</p>
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Users appreciated clear task structure but want multiple or typing options for daily reports.</li>
        <li>Adding an “Enter” button would improve usability for AI-assisted inputs.</li>
        <li>White noise and rain sounds were well received and should transition smoothly with exercises.</li>
        <li>Home screen schedules should be flexible with customizable notifications.</li>
        <li>Users expressed interest in personalizing their characters beyond the default mascot.</li>
        <li>Overall, users found check-ins efficient, AI features valuable, and relaxation exercises engaging.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>This week, our team focused on refining designs, finalizing assets, and preparing for prototyping and blog updates. The storyboard reel will be completed individually by Thursday, with Rachel drafting the next blog post.</p>
